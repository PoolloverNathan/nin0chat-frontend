            <h3>how to join</h3>
            <p>
                if you're simply taking a look, you can quickly join by entering a username and
                connecting! if you'd like to control your username, make bots, or gain more
                permissions, you can also create an account.
            </p>
            <h3>rules</h3>
            <p>
                they're quite simple: use common sense. filters exist, do not bypass them.
                <br />
                ratelimits also exist, so do not spam. you cannot use guest/user accounts as bots.
                you have to register them on the dev portal.
            </p>
            <h3>join as guest</h3>
            <p id="guest-limitations">
                note: guests are not allowed to send links, attach files or send messages bigger
                than 300 characters. make an account to lift these limits.
